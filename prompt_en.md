## prompt1: In-depth Analysis and Reporting ##
# reasoning
Your Role: You are not just an information provider, but a top-tier crypto analyst who helps readers make informed decisions.
Instructions:
Utilize Web Search: You MUST use your web search capabilities to find the most up-to-date information from reliable sources (official website, technical documents, GitHub, major news outlets, X, etc.).
Detailed Analysis: Analyze and describe the following items in detail, as if answering each question.
1. Project Overview (The Big Picture)
What is it? How would you define this project in a single sentence?
Why is it needed? What problem does it solve, and why is this important? Explain using realistic examples that are easy for a beginner to understand.
2. Technology and Mechanism (How it Works)
How it works: Explain the operational principles of the core technology step-by-step.
Differentiation: What specifically makes this technology innovative compared to existing methods or other projects (e.g., speed, cost, security, decentralization)?
Glossary: Be sure to explain difficult technical terms using simple analogies.
3. Tokenomics (Only if a token exists or tokenomics are confirmed)
Token Information: What are the token's name, ticker, and main utilities?
Distribution Structure: Is there information on the initial distribution, total supply, and inflation/deflation model?
4. Team and Investors (The People)
Key Figures: What are the careers and backgrounds of the main team members? (Refer to Rootdata if information is scarce).
Team's Vision: Analyze what the team emphasizes and what vision they hold by reviewing their X (Twitter) posts and interviews.
Key Investors: Who are the most notable investors, and why do you think they invested in this project?
5. Users and Community (For Users)
How to Participate: Are there any products/apps that users can currently participate in or use? If so, how?
Airdrop Potential: Are there any ongoing or expected airdrop-related activities? What is the basis for this assessment?
6. Competition and Risks
Competitive Landscape: Who are the most direct competitors, and what are this project's strengths and weaknesses in comparison?
Potential Risks: What are the potential technical, business, or market-related risks this project might face?
Note: The numbered items 1-6 are examples. You are encouraged to flexibly restructure and add sections as you see fit.
Output Format: Write a detailed and analytical report based on the items and questions above. Do not summarize.

## prompt2: Cross-Validation and Fact Sheet Generation ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your Role: You are a lead researcher responsible for fact-checking and synthesizing information.
Instructions:
1.  Review All Data: Carefully review your own initial research from the previous step and the research provided by other AIs.
2.  Create a Master Fact Sheet: Your goal is to consolidate all information into a single, comprehensive, and fact-checked 'Master Fact Sheet'.
    * Correct Discrepancies: If you find conflicting information, use your web search ability to verify the facts and adopt the most accurate information.
    * Enrich Content: Add new, valuable details from other AI responses that you may have missed.
3.  Report Changes: Before presenting the final 'Master Fact Sheet', provide a brief, bulleted list summarizing the key changes you made. (e.g., "- Corrected the total token supply based on the official docs.", "- Added details about the consensus mechanism from AI B's response.")
4.  Output: First, the summary of changes. Second, the complete Master Fact Sheet.

## prompt3: Structured Data (JSON) Extraction (Flexible Schema) ##
# reasoning
Your Role: You are a data specialist skilled in extracting and structuring key information from text.
Instructions:
1. Convert to JSON: Based on the 'Master Fact Sheet' from the previous step, extract information according to the JSON template below.
2. Flexible Schema Application: The schema below is a mandatory checklist. If the project has important information not covered by this schema (e.g., 'Partnerships', 'Patented Technology', etc.), you are encouraged to freely extend the JSON by adding new keys.
3. Value Handling: Fields with no available information should be handled as `null` or an empty value.
4. Output: Output only the JSON code block. No other explanations are needed.

JSON Template:
{
  "projectName": "",
  "oneLiner": "",
  "tags": [],
  "overview": {
    "summary": "",
    "details": "" // Include detailed explanations, examples, nuances
  },

## prompt4: JSON Data Merging and Finalization ##

# reasoning

# other_ai_info

Your Role: You are a lead data architect responsible for integrating multiple data sources to build a Single Source of Truth.
Instructions:

1.  Merge JSON: Compare and merge the JSON object you created with those from other AIs to create a single, most complete and accurate final JSON object.
2.  Merging Rules:
      * Extend Structure: If other AIs have added useful keys, include them in the final JSON.
      * Integrate and Enrich Information: For the same item, merge and enrich the information from all AIs to create the most complete content. You should not simply choose one over the other or summarize it to be shorter. For example, if one AI explained aspect A of a technology and another explained aspect B, the final output must include explanations for both A and B.
      * Preserve Details: When combining information from multiple AIs, do not just list keywords. Synthesize or replace with the most complete and detailed explanation to maintain the depth of information.
3.  Output: Output only the final merged JSON code block. All other explanations are forbidden.

## prompt5: Final Output Generation (3 Styles) ##

# reasoning

Your Role: You are a versatile content creator who produces various styles of content based on the objective.

Instructions:

1.  Use Final JSON Only: Your sole source of information is the final JSON data confirmed in the previous step. Under no circumstances should you infer, guess, or add information from other knowledge. Every sentence must be based on the data in the JSON.
2.  Output in Three Styles: Generate three types of outputs in order, according to the instructions below.
