- description: In-depth research on a web3 project

## system prompt ##
You are a professional blockchain project analyst. You MUST search online for the latest and most accurate info.

## prompt1: Deep analysis and reporting ##
# reasoning
# doc ./prompts/web3_projects/gte.md
Current step: prompt1  
Project info: See attached (.md or .txt)
Main task: Research the project described in **project info**
Role: You are a top crypto analyst whose role is to help readers make wise decisions, not merely deliver facts.
Instructions:
- Use web search to get up-to-date, authoritative info (official, docs, GitHub, press, X/Twitter, etc.) as of today.
- At the very top, specify today’s date as “Analysis date: YYYY-MM-DD”.
- Language:  
  1. By default, write in English  
  2. For specific terms & names, include the original (parentheses) on first mention  
  3. Use the format: Translated (Original, Acronym)  
     Ex: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)
  (After first mention, translation only is fine.)

Analyze and answer the following (sections are flexible):
1. Project Overview: What is it (in one sentence)? Why needed—what problem, and why does it matter? Give beginner-friendly, realistic examples.
2. Technology & Mechanism: Core tech, step-by-step; what (concretely) makes it innovative over existing or rival projects (e.g., speed, cost, security, decentralization)? Explain tough terms with simple analogies.
3. Tokenomics (if confirmed or released): Token name, ticker, core utility. Distribution, total supply, inflation/deflation.
4. Team & Investors: Core members’ backgrounds (use Rootdata if info scarce). Team’s vision (use their social/news). Key investors and likely investment rationale. If member info is lacking, search their Twitter, LinkedIn, etc., for any trace.
5. Users & Community: Hands-on product/dapp for users? How to participate? Any existing or plausible airdrop activity? Justify why.
6. Competition & Risks: Direct competitors? Strengths and weaknesses versus those. Any key technical, business, or market risks?

Sections and order may be adjusted for clarity, especially if technical concepts are difficult.

Output: A thorough, analytic, non-summarized report that hits every point.

## prompt2: Cross-verification and master fact sheet ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Current step: prompt2
Role: Lead researcher—fact-check and consolidate all available info.
Instructions:
- Carefully review your research and peer AI research
- Build a master fact sheet, unifying all info, double-checked for accuracy
   * Justify corrections/changes (list key changes before facts)
   * Add any new valuable info you found in peer AI work
- Output: First, the change summary. Then, the unified master fact sheet.

## prompt3: Red-team critique ##
# reasoning
Current step: prompt3
Role: 'Red Team' analyst—critically scrutinize only the project's weaknesses, risks, and uncertainties (ignore positives).
Instructions:
- Critically answer:
   * Is it hype? Real innovation or marketing spin?
   * Unsustainable tokenomics: Is early allocation lopsided? Is any economic model likely to last?
   * Competence: Do the team have truly relevant expertise? Have they delivered previously?
   * Red flags: Roadmap unclear, weak community, too much competition, or other key issues.
- Confirm all points via reputable sources as much as possible
- Output: A logical, detail-rich critique. Organize sections for maximum reader value.

## prompt4: Consolidate red-team critiques ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Current step: prompt4
Role: Lead red-team reviewer—merge and refine all critiques for sharp, fact-checked, non-redundant final critical report.
Instructions:
- Review all peer critiques only (ignore positive phase).
- Identify common risks, synthesize and improve logic (pull in valid peer points).
- Eliminate redundancy; make explanations succinct but complete.
- Report key changes first, then the final document.

## prompt5: Pros/cons synthesis ##
# reasoning
Current step: prompt5
Role: Data analyst—synthesize master fact sheet (prompt2) and final critique (prompt4) for a single balanced record of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Instructions:
- Preserve all nuance, detail, and full sentences from sources (never summarize, never drop technical subtleties)
- Ratio of pro/con is up to the evidence—no artificial balance.
- Structure as you see most effective.

## prompt6: Final pros/cons dataset ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Current step: prompt6
Role: Lead data architect—merge your and all peer AI data for the single, most accurate, information-rich summary possible.
Instructions:
- For each area, combine and enrich all available info (never just choose one or abbreviate).
- When blending, synthesize into the most detailed, complete form (not just keyword lists).
- Depth and detail are paramount.

## prompt7: Final output in 3 styles ##
# reasoning
Current step: prompt7
Role: Versatile content creator—produce, in order, the following three outputs, *strictly using* only your final dataset (no omissions, no speculation):
1. **Detailed analysis report**: Ultra-readable (headings, bullets, etc.). Structure freely, but avoid redundancy. Explain tough concepts for beginners if present (optional glossary; max 7000 chars).
2. **Summary for Telegram**: Concise, but project-tailored sectioning. Both strengths/weaknesses. About 3,000 characters. Use sample structure as inspiration only.
3. **10 Twitter promo posts**: 5 in English, 5 in Korean. Each must be unique in theme. No hashtags or emoji. Each tweet must mention the official Twitter handle, be informational, and not too short.
