**end of project info**
main request: Conduct an in-depth investigation based on **project info**.

Your role: You are not simply an information provider, but a top crypto analyst who helps readers make wise decisions.

Instructions:
- **Required web search:** You MUST use web search to obtain up-to-date information as of today from credible sources (official website, docs, GitHub, major media, X/Twitter, etc.).
- **Date statement:** Clearly state today's date at the very top of your report ("Date of Analysis: YYYY-MM-DD").
- **Language and terminology notation:**
  1. Default: All output must be in English unless specially stated.
  2. Original (English) form: When any technical term/proper noun is first mentioned, you MUST also show its original form/acronym in parentheses.
  3. Format: Translated/Explained Term (Original English Term, Acronym)
  4. Ex: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)
  5. After first use, you can simply use the term in English.
- **In-depth analysis:** For EACH section below, answer the prompt's guiding questions with clear, detailed analysis (report format).
  1. Project Overview (The Big Picture)
     - What is this project, in a single sentence?
     - Why is it needed? What problem does it address, and why is it important? Give realistic, beginner-friendly analogies.
  2. Technology & Mechanism (How it Works)
     - Operation: Describe the step-by-step core technology and mechanisms.
     - Differentiators: Exactly what is innovative compared to previous methods or competitors (e.g., speed, cost, security, decentralization)?
     - Glossary: Any complex term for blockchain novices must be explained with easy analogies.
  3. Tokenomics (only if a token exists or tokenomics is confirmed)
     - Token details: What is the name, ticker, and utility?
     - Distribution: Initial allocation, total supply, inflation/deflation mechanisms?
  4. Team & Investors (The People)
     - Key members: For main team, what backgrounds and experience do they have? (If limited info, use Rootdata.)
     - Team vision: Analyze X/Twitter/interviews for what vision and priorities they stress.
     - Key Investors: Who are the most significant investors, and why did you think they backed this?
     - **If team member data is lacking but a Twitter link is available, always check their Twitter (and follow links to LinkedIn etc.) to research who they are.**
  5. Users & Community (For Users)
     - How to participate: Can users participate directly? What product/app exists and how does it work?
     - Airdrop potential: Any ongoing or upcoming airdrop events? What is the rationale?
  6. Competition & Risks (Competition & Risks)
     - Competitive landscape: What are GTE's most direct competitors and GTE's specific strengths/weaknesses relative to them?
     - Potential risks: What technological, business, or market-side risks does this project face?
**Notes:**  
- Sections 1–6 are suggestions only. You may reorganize or add extra sections for clarity.
- If many difficult terms appear for blockchain beginners, provide a dedicated glossary/terms section for clarity.
- Output requirements: Only full, detailed analytical report is allowed; no summary.

## prompt2: Cross-Validation & Fact Sheet Generation ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your role: You are the chief fact-checker.

Instructions:
1. Review all information: Scrutinize your previous findings and all other AIs' research in this stage.
2. Master Fact Sheet: Combine all into a single, fully fact-checked "Master Fact Sheet."
    - Correct errors: For any conflicting info, you MUST use web search to discover the most accurate answer before including it.
    - Enrich content: Add any new, valuable insights from peers you may have missed.
3. Before output, briefly summarize the main changes you made (e.g., "- Revised total supply per official doc", "- Added consensus info from AI B").
4. Output: List changes first, then the completed Master Fact Sheet.

## prompt3: Red Team Critical Analysis ##
# reasoning
Your role: Critically analyze as a skeptical investor/Red Team. Omit positives; focus SOLELY on weaknesses, risks, and uncertainties.

Instructions:
1. Maintain a critical perspective: Based on the Master Fact Sheet, answer the prompts below from a Red Team perspective.
   - Hype?: Is this truly innovative or mostly rebranding old ideas? Is there marketing overreach?
   - Unsustainable tokenomics?: Is distribution overly generous for team/early investors? Is long-term value solidly modelled?
   - Strength of team?: Do member backgrounds genuinely match the project's needs? Can they deliver on the roadmap?
   - Red flags: What should investors look out for? (Unclear roadmap, inactive community, too many competitors, etc.)
2. Output: Write a logical, evidence-based critical report addressing these questions.
3. Use up-to-date, credible web sources to confirm problematic points.
*Sections 1–3 here are templates; you may design your own as appropriate.*

## prompt4: Red Team Synthesis & Final Critique ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your role: Combine all Red Team analyses (yours and peers') into a single, most logic-driven, fact-checked critical verdict.

Instructions:
1. Review only critical analyses (prompt3) from yourself and peers (ignore positives found in prompt2).
2. The final critique must synthesize all such feedback into one comprehensive, fact-checked report.
   - Highlight repeated risks and emphasize those.
   - Add convincing, logical evidence from others.
   - Merge/condense duplicate entries.
3. List changes made based on external feedback before the final output.
4. Output: Change log (bullets), then final critique.

## prompt5: Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis ##
# reasoning
Your role: Integrate both the Master Fact Sheet (prompt2) and Final Red Team Critique (prompt4) into a balanced analysis for the project.

Instructions:
1. Synthesize all content: Use all prior results to build a comprehensive assessment of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (sections/format are at your discretion).
2. Preservation: Treat this as the only source for your eventual outputs. Do NOT summarize; copy sentences and nuances exactly.
3. Balance: Reflect real positive/negative ratios as found. Don't force an even split; no explicit ratio should be mentioned.
Section breakdown is at your professional discretion.

## prompt6: Final Analysis of Strengths & Weaknesses ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your role: As the lead data architect, merge your own and all AIs' previous results into the absolute final, authoritative dataset.

Instructions:
1. Merge all content produced so far into one definitive dataset—aggregate everything, do not simply select or cut short.
2. Integration rules:
  - Integrate/enrich every section. If AI A explains tech "A" and AI B presence "B", both must show up.
  - Never reduce to keywords/short blurbs; always preserve in-depth explanations and arguments.

## prompt7: Final Outputs Generation (3 Styles) ##
# reasoning
Your role: You are a flexible content creator generating three distinct styles.

General Instructions:
1. Only use the final dataset from previous steps as your sole source ("single source of truth"): do NOT invent or add new information.
2. Generate all three outputs in the order specified.
3. Language & terminology:
   - All explanations and outputs must be in English.
   - Wherever you introduce a technical term or unique proper noun for the first time, always include the original/acronym in parentheses.
   - For all further uses, regular English is fine.

**Output 1: Detailed Analytical Report**
Specific instructions:
- Based on the following rules, compose a professional **and highly readable** detailed analytical report.
Rules & structure:
- **Readability is required:** Use headings (###), subheadings (**), bullet points (-), and clear paragraph breaks; NEVER output a "wall of text".
- **Synthesize info:** Each section must combine related material into a unified statement, without repeating across sections.
- **Objectivity:** Never write in the first person; pure objective-analyst style only.
- **Balance:** Cover both strengths and weaknesses as truly reflected in the data, NOT a forced 50:50 split.
- **Flexible sectioning:** Organize the report structure as is most effective.
- **Glossary for difficult terms:** If industry jargon is present, explain it simply in context (or use a dedicated "Glossary" section if numerous).
- **Word count:** Try to cap at 5,000 words; if more are *absolutely* needed, allow up to 7,000 but not beyond.

**Output 2: Telegram Summary Report**
Instructions:
- Use the sample structure below for inspiration, but freely adapt as fits the project.
- Summary must give fair, balanced (strengths & weaknesses) view.
- Limit total output to around 3,000 characters.
- The structure/example below is for style reference—DO NOT directly copy/cite its content.
