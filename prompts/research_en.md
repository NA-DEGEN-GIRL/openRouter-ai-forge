     - Potential risks: What technical, business, or market risks may GTE face?
  *Note: Sections 1-6 are examples. You may restructure/add/merge additional sections as you see fit. For blockchain projects with lots of jargon, add a dedicated "glossary" or beginner explanations section as needed.*

Output requirements: Provide a detailed, analytical report, structured by the topics above. Summarization is NOT allowed.

## prompt2: Cross-Validation & Fact Sheet Generation ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your Role: You are the chief researcher, responsible for checking and synthesizing all facts.

Instructions:
1. Review all data: Closely review your own and all other AIs’ research from the previous stage.
2. Produce the Master Fact Sheet: Integrate all information into a comprehensive, fully fact-checked master fact sheet.
    - Correct conflicting info: You MUST use web search to resolve inconsistencies and only include facts you are confident about.
    - Supplement content: Add any uniquely valuable points found in other AI answers that were missing in yours.
3. Before the fact sheet, list key changes you made with concise bullet points (e.g., "- Updated total token supply based on official docs", "- Added consensus details from AI B").
4. Output: First, change log. Second, the completed master fact sheet.

## prompt3: Red Team Critical Analysis ##
# reasoning
Your Role: Now, as a Red Team (critical) analyst taking an investor's skeptical perspective, focus solely on weaknesses, risks, and doubts—ignore positives.

Instructions:
1. Stay critical: Based on the master fact sheet above, answer the following from a critical viewpoint:
   - Hype?: Is the tech truly groundbreaking, or just a minor tweak of old ideas? What's hidden behind the marketing speak?
   - Unsustainable tokenomics?: Is initial allocation overly generous to the team/early investors? Is the long-term value model robust?
   - Team capability?: Are team backgrounds genuinely relevant? Is their ability to deliver on the roadmap proven?
   - Red flags: What are must-know risks? (e.g., vague roadmap, weak community, excessive competition, etc.)
2. Output: Write detailed, logical critical analysis addressing the above.
3. Use credible web sources as evidence for each critical claim.
*Sections 1-3 are suggested; freely restructure as you see fit.*

## prompt4: Red Team Synthesis & Final Critique ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your Role: Synthesize all critical analyses (yours and other AIs’) for the sharpest, most logically rigorous final verdict.

Instructions:
1. Only review critiques from prompt3 (ignore positives from prompt2 in this phase).
2. Summarize all opinions into one comprehensive, fact-checked final critique.
    - Core risk synthesis: Highlight central risks echoed by multiple critiques.
    - Strengthen logic: Integrate valid reasoning from others into your own analysis.
    - Deduplicate: Merge findings covering identical grounds for conciseness.
3. Before the final output, briefly list any changes you made based on peer critiques.
4. Output: First, change summary. Second, the finalized critique.

## prompt5: Analysis of Strengths & Weaknesses ##
# reasoning
Your Role: Aggregate positive (prompt2) and critical (prompt4) analyses into an overall, balanced evaluation.

Instructions:
1. Synthesize info: Use the master fact sheet and the final critical report to assess strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks.
2. Preservation rule: This document serves as your single source of truth—do NOT summarize; preserve full texts and nuances.
3. Balanced assessment: Let your weighting of pros/cons reflect actual findings (e.g., if 90% is positive, reflect it). Never force a 50:50 split. *Do not spell out explicit ratios.*
Sections and organization are left up to your best expert judgment.

## prompt6: Final Strengths & Weaknesses Evaluation ##
# reasoning
# other_ai_info
Your Role: As lead data architect, merge your and other AIs’ data into one single, most accurate source of truth.

Instructions:
1. Merge all relevant analyses and evaluations from previous steps and all AIs’ output into a single comprehensive dataset.
2. Rules:
   - Fully integrate: For any topic, merge and enrich all information. Don't choose or summarize arbitrarily—include BOTH aspect A (from one AI) and B (from another) if present.
   - Always preserve the highest level of detail and nuance.

## prompt7: Final Output Generation (3 Styles) ##
# reasoning
Your Role: As an accomplished content creator, you will produce three different output styles.

General instructions:
1. Use only the finalized dataset created in previous steps—never guess, invent, or supplement missing information.
2. Output all three product styles in order below.
3. **Language and terminology rules:**
   - All descriptions must be in English.
   - For technical/proper terms when first mentioned, always include the original/acronym. Thereafter, English alone is sufficient.
   - You must use the final, prior data. DO NOT use any source or outside knowledge not contained in the final dataset.

**Output 1: Detailed Analytical Report**
Instructions for Output 1: Based on the following rules, write a highly readable, professional, and fully structured analysis.
Structure & rules:
- *Readability structure required*: Use headings (###), subheadings (**), bullet points (-), and break up content with paragraphs. Never submit long, unbroken narrative blocks.
- Information synthesis: Each section must integrate related information into a unified explanation, with no repeat content across sections.
- Objective style: Never use first-person ("I think..."), but always a professional, analytic tone.
- Balanced viewpoint: Cover strengths and weaknesses as truly reflected in the data (do not force 50:50 ratio).
- Flexible structure: You are free to structure the report as you find most effective overall.
- Explain difficult terms: Where blockchain jargon is present, explain terms in simple English. If many key terms, include a dedicated glossary or explainer section.
- No limit on report length.

**Output 2: Telegram Summary Report**
Instructions for Output 2:
- Use the structure below for inspiration but adjust, add, or remove sections freely to best fit the project.
- The report must provide a balanced view, including both strengths and weaknesses.
